# Heroyn Java librairies and plugins

Heroyn is a Minecraft server network project, closed in 2018.

Here are the main Java realisations I developped for the project.
The realisations are split in two parts :
- The librairies/API, used by other sub-libraries or plugins.
- Plugins, adding exclusive content for players.
